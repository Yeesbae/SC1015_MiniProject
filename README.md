# Welcome to SC1015 Mini Project
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting IMDB Rating based on the dataset retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/imdb-dataset-top-2000-movies

## Problem Definition

Are we able to predict if a movie is good (rating above 6) based on its attributes? <br />
Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Machine Learning algorithms used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

## Conclusion
1. Metascore has the highest correlation with IMDB Ratings
2. Dataset is distributed unevenly and skewed towards higher IMDB Ratings
3. Model created using Decision tree has a high False Positive Rate
4. Model for Logistic Regression created using this data can only predict IMDB rating above 6 due to the dataset.
5. Models are improved by using Multi variables to predict data, with Metascore being the most important variable

## What did we learn from this project
1. Alpha pruning for Decision Tree <br/>
2. Able to discern unnecessary information given a pool of data <br/>
3. Understood machine learning models used (Regression Line,Decision Tree) <br/>
4. Understood Random forest model <br/>
5. Convert text to weighted numerical representations <br/>
6. Learnt to use github efficiently for group work 

## Credit for data
For the data set that we used, it was from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/imdb-dataset-top-2000-movies
